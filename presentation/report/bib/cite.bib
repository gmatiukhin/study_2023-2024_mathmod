  Abstract = {The hallmarks of cultural behavior include consistency within and
              across individuals, variance between populations, behavioral
              stickiness, and possibly suboptimal performance. In this paper, we
              build a formal framework within which these behavioral attributes
              emerge from the interactions of purposive agents. We then derive
              mathematical results showing these behaviors are optimal given our
              assumptions. Our framework rests on two primary assumptions: (i)
              agents play ensembles of games, not just single games as is
              traditionally the case in evolutionary game theory models and (ii)
              agents have finite cognitive capacity. Our analysis combines
              agent-based techniques and mathematics, enabling us to explore
              dynamics and to prove when the behaviors produced by the agents are
              equilibria. Our results provide game theoretic foundations for
              cultural diversity and agent-based support for how cultural
              behavior might emerge.},
